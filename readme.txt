v1/ contains a brainfuck compiler that outputs assembly files, and utilizes the
GNU assembler/linker. It targets 64-bit Linux, but is written in standard C.

v2/ contains a compiler which emits executables directly, and targets 32-bit
Linux. Said executables are much smaller than the ones generated by v1/, partly
due to some optimizations of the generated code itself (better register
allocation, coalescing repeated operations, and using 32-bit registers), and
partly due to not using the system linker. Note that even though the executables
it emits are 32-bit, they can still run just fine on 64-bit kernels, even
without any 32-bit libraries installed (as they make syscalls directly and don't
link against any library).
